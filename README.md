# GSAT-WalkSAT
Different heuristics and random initialization methods applied to GSAT and WalkSAT algorithms

This project focuses on GSAT and WalkSAT algorithms and their extensions which are particularly used to solve the Boolean satisfiability problem. The goal of this project is to compare the performances of the cited algorithms with different heuristics. The ability to find the model and the algorithm run-time are the two main comparison criteria which have been used in this project. Another important aspect of the project is the random initializations of the algorithms which turns out to be one significant factor to avoid the local maxima. Different random initialization methods were discussed in this report altogether with their implementational details.

### How to Run 

You can use the prebuilt binary file or compile the source files using the make command.
To run the benchmarks, choose the heuristic algorithm (by uncommentig the specified algorithm in the batch files), and run the batch file using the shell.
